# The 4.7 km Illusion

On **21 November 2025**, standing on **Alcatraz Island**, I took a handheld photo of the **Golden Gate Bridge** using a **Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**. The image was captured with approximately **10–30× zoom** using the phone’s periscope telephoto system. The result is visually pleasing. The bridge appears close — almost trivial in distance.  It is not! Smartphone Cameras Makes Distances Look Short…

## The  Truth

**The geodesic distance (straight-line distance) between Fort Point and Alcatraz is approximately 4.7 km.** This is a coordinate-based, geodetic measurement. It is independent of roads, routes, tides, or visual perception. The number is correct. The intuition is wrong.

*Wide reference view showing the full span between Alcatraz and Fort Point.* 

*Open water provides almost no intermediate depth cues, strongly biasing visual judgment.* This image establishes scale. Everything that follows explains why that scale feels incorrect. The camera creates the illusion: 



The photo was taken with a **Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**, released **31 January 2024**.

| Component           | Specification                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Main camera         | 200 MP, f/1.7 wide-angle              |
| Ultra-wide          | 12 MP                                 |
| Telephoto           | 10 MP, ~3× optical                    |
| Periscope telephoto | 50 MP, ~5× optical                    |
| Maximum zoom        | Up to 100× (hybrid/digital)           |
| Stabilization       | Optical + electronic                  |
| Processing          | Multi-frame computational photography |

At **10–30× zoom**, the phone combines high native pixel density, optical magnification, and aggressive computational sharpening. What it does **not** do is reduce physical distance. Camera Assessment (DXOMARK); 

According to **DXOMARK’s camera review** of the Galaxy S24 Ultra: **Strengths**: Very high detail in bright light, Strong telephoto performance, and improved texture and noise handling over the previous generation with **Limitations**; Occasional focus instability, Video focus transitions can lag, Not class-leading in all scenarios, In short, the camera is technically excellent — and very good at creating convincing distance illusions.

## The Zoomed Details

![image-20251225184045632](./image-20251225184045632.png)
*20–30× zoomed capture of the Golden Gate Bridge from Alcatraz.* 

*Telephoto compression collapses depth and removes spatial context.* This is where perception breaks.

## 4.7 km Looks Shorter

**Telephoto Compression (Physics, Not Opinion):** Long focal lengths compress depth along the viewing axis. Foreground, midground, and background appear stacked together. This effect is deliberately used in cinema, sports photography, and surveillance imagery. **Water Eliminates Depth Cues:** Between Alcatraz and Fort Point there are no buildings, roads, trees, or parallax references. Flat water is the worst possible surface for human distance estimation. **Scale Bias from a Massive Structure:** The Golden Gate Bridge is enormous — a main span of ~1,280 m and towers ~227 m tall. Large objects subconsciously signal proximity, even when far away. Making the Distance Intuitive — here’s some Real-World References, All of these distances feel manageable when viewed casually. None of them are short in physical reality.:

### Distance References 

| Location / Reference Pair                             | Geodesic Distance |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Fort Point → Alcatraz Island (San Francisco)          | ~4.7 km           |
| Tamburveien 3 (Nydalen) → Oslo Opera House (Bjørvika) | ~4.6–4.8 km       |
| Slemmestad coast → Kolbotn coast (Oslofjorden)        | ~4.5–5.0 km       |
| Tower Bridge → Canary Wharf (London)                  | ~4.6–4.8 km       |

This illusion explains why Alcatraz <u>SWIMS</u> are underestimated, modern smartphones distort spatial intuition more than classic cameras ever did. Higher resolution increases **detail**, not **truthfulness**.  The Final Takeaway: **Yes, the distance is ~4.7 km.** **Yes, it looks much shorter in the photo.**, and **No, human intuition is not reliable here.**

*All distances referenced in this article are geodesic (straight-line distances) unless explicitly stated otherwise.*
