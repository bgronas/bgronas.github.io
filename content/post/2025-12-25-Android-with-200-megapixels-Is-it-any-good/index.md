# The 4.7 km Illusion

On **21 November 2025**, standing on **Alcatraz Island**, I took a handheld photo of the **Golden Gate Bridge** using a **Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**. The image was captured with somewhere around **20× zoom** (maybe more) on that phone. The result is quite gratifying. The bridge appears closer — almost trivial in distance. The Camera Made the distance Look Short.. But.. 

**The geodesic distance (straight-line distance) between Fort Point and Alcatraz is approximately 4.7 km!!** This is a coordinate-based, geodetic measurement. It is independent of roads, routes, tides, or visual perception.

*Wide reference view showing the full span between Alcatraz and Fort Point.* 

*Open water provides almost no intermediate depth cues, strongly biasing visual judgment.* This image establishes the actual scale. The camera creates the illusion: 

Both these photos were taken with a **Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**, (new in ** January 2024**.)

| Component           | Specification                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Main camera         | 200 MP, f/1.7 wide-angle              |
| Ultra-wide          | 12 MP                                 |
| Telephoto           | 10 MP, ~3× optical                    |
| Periscope telephoto | 50 MP, ~5× optical                    |
| Maximum zoom        | Up to 100× (hybrid/digital)           |
| Stabilization       | Optical + electronic                  |
| Processing          | Multi-frame computational photography |

> According to **DXOMARK’s camera review** of the Galaxy S24 Ultra: **Strengths**: Very high detail in bright light, Strong telephoto performance, and improved texture and noise handling over the previous generation with **Limitations**; Occasional focus instability, Video focus transitions can lag, Not class-leading in all scenarios. In short, the camera is technically pretty good enough. 

## Zoom

At **20× zoom**, the phone combines high native pixel density, optical magnification, and aggressive computational sharpening. What it does **not** do is reduce physical distance.

## 4.7 km Looks Shorter

**Telephoto Compression:** Long focal lengths compress depth along the viewing axis. Foreground, midground, and background appear stacked together. This effect is deliberately used in cinema, sports photography, and surveillance imagery. **Water Eliminates Depth Cues:** Between Alcatraz and Fort Point there are no buildings, roads, trees, or parallax references. Flat water is the worst possible surface for human distance estimation. **A Massive Structure:** *The Golden Gate Bridge is enormous — a main span of ~1,280 m and towers ~227 m tall.* Large objects subconsciously signal proximity, even when far away. Making the Distance Intuitive — and here’s some Real-World References:



### Distance References

| Location / Reference Pair                                 | Geodesic Distance |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Fort Point → Alcatraz Island (San Francisco)              | ~4.7 km           |
| Tamburveien 3 (Nydalen) → **Oslo** Opera House (Bjørvika) | ~4.6–4.8 km       |
| Slemmestad coast → Kolbotn coast (**Oslofjorden**)        | ~4.5–5.0 km       |
| Tower Bridge → Canary Wharf (**London**)                  | ~4.6–4.8 km       |

This illusion explains why Alcatraz <u>SWIMS</u> were underestimated. High resolution fixes **details**, not the **truth**.  Final Takeaway: **Yes, the distance is ~4.7 km.**
